## E-commerce High-level Guidelines

For small and medium enterprises as well as small/home offices, the official guide lines are under __(CGESP - 1: 2019)__ from NCA. These guidelines are further supplemented by __(ECC - 1: 2018)__. Both of these documents serve as excellent checklists on what needs to be done or considered when using an E-Commerce platform.

The __(CGESP)__ complements other related national laws, regulations, frameworks, and standards overseen by the following government organizations:

* Ministry of Commerce and Investment (MoC).
* National Cybersecurity Authority (NCA).
* Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA).
