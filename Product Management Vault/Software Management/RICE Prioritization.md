## Definitions
### Formula
`RICE Score = (Reach x Impact x Confidence) / Effort`

**Reach**
> Is the measure of how many users or stakeholders will be affected by a particular task or feature.
> Typically measured in the amount of users whole will be affected or using this feature. e.g. if 10,000 users use the product, but the feature is only used by 2,000 users, then the *reach score* will be 2,000.

**Impact**
> Evaluates the potential positive effect that a task or feature can have on the product, users, or business goals.
> Typically measured on this scale:
> * 3 = Massive impact
> * 2 = High impact
> * 1 = Medium impact
> * 0.5 = Low impact
> * 0.25 = Minimal impact

**Confidence**
> Represents the level of certainty the team has in their *impact* and *effort* estimates for a given task or feature.
> Typically measured on this scale:
> * 100% = Fully confident
> * 80% = Medium confidence
> * 50% = Low confidence
> * \> 50% = Guessing

**Effort**
> Gauges the resources, including time, workforce, and budget required to complete a task or implement a feature.
> Typically measured in *person-months*. e.g. if a feature will take 3 months to complete with a team of 5 people, then the *effort score* would be 15 person-months.
