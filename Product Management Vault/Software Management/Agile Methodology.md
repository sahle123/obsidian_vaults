### Structuring work in Agile

0. **Initiative**: #fill_in_later 

1. **Epic**: An epic is a large body of work that can be broken down into smaller tasks or stories. Epics are usually too big to be completed in a single iteration or sprint, so they are broken down into smaller, more manageable pieces. Epics often represent high-level features or initiatives that provide value to the customer or end user. 

2. **User Story**: A user story is a small, self-contained unit of work that represents a single piece of functionality from an end user's perspective. User stories are typically written in a specific format: "As a 'type of user', I want 'some goal' so that 'some reason.'" They are meant to capture the requirements and expectations of the end user in a simple, understandable way. User stories are small enough to be completed within a single iteration or sprint.

3. **Task**: Depending on the organization, it appears tasks can have the same scope as a story or be smaller than one. For the sake of simplicity, we will say that tasks are smaller than user stories and follow different acceptance criteria as well as description of the work to be done. Multiple tasks can be done in the span of a single sprint.
