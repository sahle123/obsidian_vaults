## PM Best Practices
  
* Prioritize ruthlessly; understand the cost and benefit of each decision.
* Know the lay of the land:
    * Start by asking many questions --> with customers, with the business, with industry leaders.
    * Understand the business model and history.
* Empower your team to make their own decisions.
    * Enabling your team to make their own decisions starts by creating a shared context. Most teammates (9 times out of 10) can make their own decisions if they knew what was going on.
* Influence w/o authority:
    * Take teammates out for coffee; get to know who they are.
    * Know which levers to pull --> some people want a good story, some want to see if you can work, some want to know if you're on schedule.
    * Use authority as a last resort. You will generally lose some faith of team members whenever this option is invoked.
