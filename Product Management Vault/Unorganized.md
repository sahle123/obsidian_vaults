## Key Issues + Pitfalls

### Balancing the Strategic and Tactical

* (Tactical) <-----> (Strategic)
* Sales support <-----> Product support
* "Just getting things done" <-----> Agile process details
* Non-core projects (e.g. project management, financial reporting, ops support) <-----> Core projects (e.g. revenue-generating products)

	* Deep customer understanding
	* Market and competitive analysis
	* Product strategy
	* New product discovery & concept testing
	* Product analytics
	* Pricing
	* Search for growth
* Gently say "no" and try to reduce:
	* Project management
	* Extensive product support
	* Getting buried in Agile processes
	* Deep engineering support
	* Extensive sales support
