[In honor of trying out this](https://fev.al/posts/work-journal/)

# Idea and Motivation
* An area to write down current thoughts or process for some complex problem that is being worked on.
* This should be considered _cache_ and is entirely disposable unless I feel it is worthy of keeping as a record. e.g. steps on how to fix Pg 4 Admin's missing backup utility that seems to mysteriously disappear after an update.
