*  _The Speedrunning Algorithm_:
	1. Make an outline of the project.
	2. For each item in the outline, make an outline. Do this recursively until the items are small enough.
	3. Fill in each item as fast as possible. Do **NOT** perfect as you go! This is a huge, common mistake.
	4. Finally, once completely done, go back and perfect.
* _Much of becoming really efficient is about getting extremely cracked at the fundamentals (many of which you probably mistakenly dismiss_.)
* _There is immense amounts of wisdom/utility/alpha in re-evaluating any fundamentals that your mind dismisses as unimportant. Much improvement in any performance-based field comes from fixing these mis-evaluations_.

### Arthur C. Brooks
* Experiences that have a positive outcome on one's 'happiness' require:
    * People
    * Memories
* "Hedonic treadmill" = more, more, more; never enough. The baseline moves up and more is needed to be "happy"
* Successful people want less. "Be content with what you have, not with what you want."
