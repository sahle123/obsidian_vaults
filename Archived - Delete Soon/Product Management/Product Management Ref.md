# What should you do when you join Badael:

* Do customer interviews early and often (within the 1st or 2nd month upon joining).

# PM Overview

## PM Goals

* Create customer value.
* Generate long-term competitive advantage.
* Delivery year-after-year profitability.

## Product Manager Key Points

* Person who identifies customer needs and the larger business objectives that a product or feature will fulfill.
* Explains what success for a product looks like.
* Puts together a team to make product into reality.
* Product Managers must make trade-offs between UX, Tech, and Business.
* They can be thought of as "the CEO of a product".

## PM Responsibilities

* Product research
* Understanding and representing user needs.
* Monitoring the market and developing competitive analyses.
* Defining a vision for a product.
* Aligning stakeholders around the vision for the product.
* Prioritizing product features and capabilities.

## PM Best Practices

* Prioritize ruthlessly; understand the cost and benefit of each decision.
* Know the lay of the land:
    * Start by asking many questions --> with customers, with the business, with industry leaders.
    * Understand the business model and history.
* Empower your team to make their own decisions.
    * Enabling your team to make their own decisions starts by creating a shared context. Most teammates (9 times out of 10) can make their own decisions if they knew what was going on.
* Influence w/o authority:
    * Take teammates out for coffee; get to know who they are.
    * Know which levers to pull --> some people want a good story, some want to see if you can work, some want to know if you're on schedule.
    * Use authority as a last resort. You will generally lose some faith of team members whenever this option is invoked.

# Market Intelligence

## Customers Analysis

* _The customer's needs guide everything a product manager does_
* There are 2 ways to analyze and share customer data
    1. Personas
    2. Kano model

### Interviewing Customers

* First rule of an excellent product manager: do customer interviews __early__ and __often__!
* Talk to real customers (users and buyers).
* Start with the easiest, friendliest, least-risky customers. Expand after that.
* Do these interviews together with your product designer and your engineering lead.
* Keep all bias out of your voice, your questions, and your body language. Never judge; you are there to listen and observe.
* Be careful with sales reps.
* Find the emotions!
* Interview continuously (goal is 10/quater or about 1/week).

### Customer Interivew Steps

1. Clarify your objectives; keep them simple
2. Craft an interview guide
3. Recruit respondents
4. Conduct the interview
5. Test your new product concepts
6. Analyze, share, and use insights gained
7. Rinse and repeat all above steps

### Personas

* A one-person stand-in for a segment of customers.
* When making personas, try to capture the depth, flavor, and emotions. They **humanize** the target customer. They generally are created to be quite personalized.
* Useful for communicating w/ our engineering, marketing, sales, and exec teams.
* N.B. if _users_ and _buyers_ are separate people, then we may want separate personas.

### Kano Model

* Please refer to the PDF for graphs that illustrate the 3 broad need categories.
* Kano need categories:
    * Basic needs - _"Must be" requirements_
    * Performance needs - _Stated, more is usually better_
    * Attractive needs (delighters) - _Unstated, not expected_

## Market Analysis

### Market Segmentation

* Market segmentation is the process of dividing a broad market into groups of customers w/ similar needs.
    * Refer to PDF file for a tabluar example.
* There are several ways to segment the market, but generally **needs-based segmentation** is used.
* We use this to compare, evaluate, and select markets we (as the business) want to target.
* Steps are as follows:
    1. Identify segments --> cluster customers w/ very similar needs.
    2. Profile segments --> description + size.

### Sizing Market Segments

* This data can be found in published market sizing reports.
* Can be estimated based on our own sales data, our estimated market share, and feedback from channel partners.
* This step constantly needs refinement since the data is never perfect and the market continually changes.

## Competitive Analysis

* As the business, we want to develop a long-term competitive advantage for our products. Concretely, we need to be better than all competing alternatives at meeting customer needs.

* To develop this competitive distance (or advantage), we need to **monitor** and **analyze** our competitors.

### Why Analyze Competitors?

* Spot threats and opportunities early.
* Craft counter-attack strategies.
* Learn from competitors --> i.e. their successes, their failures.
* Hone our pricing.
* Create hard-to-copy advantages.

### Types of Competition:

* **Direct Competition**: the companies you meet in the market everyday.
* **Disruptive Technology**: meeting customer needs in a fundamentally different way.

### Analyzing the Competition

* Ideally, 2 to 3 direct competitors should be identified. Going beyond isn't always necessary.
* The 4 questions to answer when analyzing a competitor:
    1. How important is this competitor (now and in the future)? How much revenue do they generate? Market share? Their trends?
    2. How does this competitor approach the market today and in the future?
    3. How are we differentiated from this competitor? Positioning?
    4. How do their products stack up to ours? Product comparison?
* Some questions to ask when evaluating a competitor's approach --> What is their:
    * strategic direction?
    * target market?
    * strengths and core competencies?
    * weaknesses?
    * gaps?
    * go-to-market approach?
    * pricing?
* Note that you should seek a wide variety of sources for this data.
    * **Internal experts**: sales teams, market research analysts, ex-employees of competitors, execs.
    * **External sources**: websites, social media postings, job postings, press releases, tradeshows, YouTube interviews of CEOs.
* Use a product comparison table w/ a list of features and how each competitor scores or performs in each feature.
    * Be sure to keep this list short and focused only on important features & benefits. Listing everything is wasteful.
    * Involve sales team, UX designers, and engineers.

### Competitive Monitoring

* **Continuous** - Analyzes most critical competitors. Done on an on-going basis.
* **Periodic** - Analyzes key competitors and competitive trends, and disruptive technologies. Conducted every 6 months.
* **Project-based** - Analyzes new competitive entrants, new products/services, new technologies. Conducted as needed; no steady cycle.

# Unorganized

## Key Issues + Pitfalls

### Balancing the Strategic and Tactical

* (Tactical) <-----> (Stategic)
* Sales support <-----> Product support
* "Just getting things done" <-----> Agile process details
* Non-core projects (e.g. project mgmt, financial reporting, ops support) <-----> Core projects (e.g. revenue-generating products)

### Balancing Resposibilites

* Say "yes" and lean into:
    * Deep customer understanding
    * Market and competitive analysis
    * Product strategy
    * New product discovery & concept testing
    * Product analytics
    * Pricing
    * Search for growth
* Gently say "no" and try to reduce:
    * Project management
    * Extensive product support
    * Getting buried in Agile processes
    * Deep engineering support
    * Extensive sales support
